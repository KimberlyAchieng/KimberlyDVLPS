👩‍💻 About Me

💼 I’m a full-stack developer in training, passionate about building real-world projects that solve meaningful problems.

🔭 Currently pursuing a software engineering certificate at PHP Academy and building my portfolio from scratch.

🌍 Based in Nairobi, Kenya — actively seeking freelance, internship, and remote opportunities.

💬 Let’s talk about web development, JavaScript, MongoDB, and growing in tech with zero capital but full commitment.

⚡ Fun fact: I pivoted from a paused university degree to hands-on coding, learning every day and loving the grind!
